        "The **auto_multipoint_extractor** program allows the user to extract multiple points automatically. The program extracts cell values and multipoints, at locations specified in a point feature class from one or more rasters and records the value to the attribute table of the point feature class, by creating multipoints. Consequently, multi-points are useful for geoprocessing tasks where the user needs to work with coordinates. This tool modifies the input point features and the cell values will be extracted from all input rasters at each location.\n",
