        "The Machine Learning technique used will be eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), specifically XGB without verifier. XGBoost regressor is a machine learning algorithm that excels in predictive accuracy. XGBoost regression model builds a series of tree's one after another, where each new tree learns from the previous created tree's errors and improves until it reaches its maximum improvement. XGBoost, in contrast to Gradient Boosting, introduces several optimizations such as improved regularization, can handle larger data, is more adaptable to various problems, and has built-in capabilities to handle missing data.\n",

For our case, we used a random sample of 1000 from the train data. We then apply SHAP to analyze those 1000 row samples and calculate the contribution of each feature for the 1000 predictions. SHAP assigns values according to the mean marginal contribution of each feature across all possible values. Using this method, you will be able to see a bar graph that illustrates the individual contribution of each feature.
