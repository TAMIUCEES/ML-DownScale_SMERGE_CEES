        "The **static_var_gen** program enables users to generate a new CSV file that leverages static variables from the original dataset. This is achieved by constructing home paths and the name of the dataset containing the static data. The program then verifies the existence of the file. This functionality aids users in creating a file that tracks related data and allows for the display of a table containing the aforementioned data.\n",

        "* **modin.pandas** - Distributes and computes data faster by using API.\n",
        "* **matplotlib.pyplot** - Creates data visualization (i.e. graphs)\n",
        "* **seaborn** - Statistical graphs.\n",
        "* **string** - Allows strings or data to be split when needed.\n",
        "* **warnings** - Informs the user of the state of the code or where an error has occurred.\n",
        "* **sys** - Provides a way to manipulate the runtime of the program by using certain parameters and functions.\n",
