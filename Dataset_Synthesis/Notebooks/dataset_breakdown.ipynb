        "The ***dataset_breakdown*** program gathers data from the user input in the form of a CSV file then breaks down the data in the file. The user can then select whether the file will be broken down as a directory or individually. If the user chooses to break down all CSV files, they will need to input the resolution ID. Organizing data in a file by breaking it down allows the user to sort the values in the file.\n",
