        "The **multiBand_raster_extractor** program offers effective band extraction and reordering functionalities. It allows the extraction of one or more bands or the reorganization of bands as a multiband raster layer. With this tool, users can easily create a duplicate raster file as the output. A multiband raster is a versatile image or data file that contains multiple bands, each representing different wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum. These bands capture essential data for a wide range of applications, including vegetation analysis, land use mapping, and environmental studies.\n",
