        "The **netCDF_layer_extractor** program leverages the **find_files** function to locate and modify file names for each path. This feature enables users to generate new files and perform data resampling, making it valuable for subsequent analysis and modeling that involve a dimension. The program also allows users to export the *netCDF_raster_layer* to another raster format, with the exported raster file serving as the input for various tools. Additionally, it is designed for viewing dimensions and variables, as well as extracting data from \"*.nc* \" files.\n",
