        "Similar to *auto_zonal_stats*, the **auto_multiD_subsetting** program enables users to acquire data and raster more efficiently by processing and resampling data raster on an individual layer basis. The outputs of the *auto_multiD_subsetting* program then serve as the inputs for the *auto_zonal_stats* program. Like *auto_zonal_stats*, *auto_multiD_subsetting* allows for the file resampling, enabling raster file size conversion by raster layer. The program calculates multi-dimensions by subsetting larger files, facilitating efficient subset data extraction and manipulation. Subsequently, this tool creates a subset of a multidimensional raster by slicing data along specified variables and dimensions. It generates a multidimensional raster layer from a multidimensional raster or mosaic dataset by extracting a subset of variables.  \n",
